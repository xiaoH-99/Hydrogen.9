As a member of the planning department of the Nutrition Society of the School of Medicine of our university, I am responsible for formulating detailed activity plans for the Nutrition Society after discussing with department members based on current nutrition trends and public health needs, such as Nutrition Week, healthy restaurant visits, etc. Once the plan is approved by the society, our department will work closely with other departments to coordinate and implement the activities. After the activities are completed, we will summarize the activities and provide suggestions for making more complete and interesting activity plans for the next time.
