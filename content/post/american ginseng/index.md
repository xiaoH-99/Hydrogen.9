In this paper, I used Endnote to collect literature on American ginseng, and analyzed its six aspects:background introduction, horticultural characteristics and distribution, pharmacological effects and medicinal cuisine, nutritional value, product development and application prospects, and safety issues. I summarized the benefits of American ginseng for the human body, its effectiveness in various fields, and its potential toxicity.
