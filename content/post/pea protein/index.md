In this review, I was responsible for researching literature on the effects of emerging technologies—such as high-power ultrasound, pulsed electric field, high hydrostatic pressure, and microwaves—on pea protein quality including amino acid composition, digestibility, and bioavailability. Based on the relevant data, I created comparative tables including conventional and emerging technologies, their application conditions, and effects of processing technologies on pea protein quality to compare the impacts of different technologies on pea protein.
