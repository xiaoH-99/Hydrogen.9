In this group project, I researched the impact of various new preservatives on fruit quality, identifying the advantages of chlorine dioxide over other preservatives for navel oranges. Applying qualitative and quantitative methods, experiments were designed to test the preservative effects of different chlorine dioxide concentrations on navel oranges inoculated with three microorganisms. Simulated commercial conditions replicate transportation and storage, exploring the impact of different release speeds of chlorine dioxide on preservation effectiveness. The design of controlled-release chlorine dioxide gas is expected to reduce microbial count and extend the shelf life of navel oranges, which is effective in providing a reliable solution for food preservation technology.
