abstract: The food packaging is a practical and novel pasta storage container. It features an adjustable lid and dispensing hole marked with pasta weight and calorie information, allowing users to control the amount of pasta based on their needs. The calculation of the pasta's weight is based on the “Chinese Dietary Nutrient Reference Intakes” and the hole size is designed according to the cross-sectional area corresponding to each weight of the pasta. This design of packaging is both convenient and scientifically grounded.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
